# Data Driven Tests

Put here a directory named [whatever] containing (at least) the following files:
 - config.yaml: containing the description of the analysis to perform
 - expect.log: the expected output of the test

Specifing the URLs to the artifacts using the [file://] protocol the test will look in the [whatever] directory for them
